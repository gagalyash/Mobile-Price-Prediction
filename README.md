# Problem Statement

The client plans to start a mobile phone company. He wants to give tough fights to big companies such as Apple, Samsung, Huawei and others. However, the cient now faces a problem to set the price of the mobile phone.
In order to set a reasonable price, he needs to predict the price of the mobile phone based on the features of the mobile phone. Hence, the client has collected the sales data of mobile phones of different companies. He cannot simply set a price for the mobile phone because the price is the main consideration for many people when buying a mobile phone. He needs to figure out the relationship between features of a mobile phone(eg:- battery power, RAM etc) and its selling price.
To solve this problem, he decided to approach us to help him using Machine Learning techniques. In this problem we are predicting the price range indicating how high the price should be relative to the competition instead of the actual prices.
